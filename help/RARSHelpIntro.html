<h3>BIT-RARS - Risc-V Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 0.1</h4>
<h4>November 2018</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
</center>
BIT-RARS is a work base on MARS(http://www.cs.missouristate.edu/MARS/).
<p>
    <p>BIT stands for <b>B</b>eijing <b>I</b>nstitute of <b>T</b>echnology</p>
RARS, the <b>R</b>isc-V <b>A</b>ssembler and <b>R</b>untime <b>S</b>imulator,
will assemble and simulate the execution of Risc-V assembly language programs.
It can be used through its integrated development environment (IDE).  
RARS is written in Java and requires at least Release 1.6 of the J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to work.
It is distributed as an executable JAR file.
The source code can be found at <tt><b>https://github.com/jiweixing/bit-rars</b></tt>.

<p>As of Release 0.1, RARS assembles and simulates over 30 basic instructions of the RV32I
instruction set, few pseudo-instructions or instruction variations, several syscall functions
mainly for console, random number generation and more.  These are listed in separate help tabs.
<p>
When writing RARS, the reference is "riscv-spec-v2.2" and "https://github.com/riscv". 
Although work has been done according to the standard format and usage of Risc-V as much as possible,
    we still have to compromise a lot for our work is based on MARS which is a tool for MIPS.
<p>If you find any error, please tell us !</p>
