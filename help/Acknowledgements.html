    Hello, I want to say thinks again for using RARS, which is the first software I write, or modified, to be specific.
<p>
    Currently I am a Undergraduate. I wrote this software under the help from A.P. Ji from BIT and his excellent students. It feel beyond good to have you all!
<p>
    In the end, I also want to say thinks to Pete and Ken, by whom MARS was written, for the excellent work you have done.
