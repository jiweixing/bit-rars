# BIT-RARS : a RISC-V Simulator in Java 


## 1. Introduction
### BIT-RARS is a RISC-V simulator for teaching developed by Yueyan Zhao, Anmin Li and Weixing Ji at Beijing Institute of Technology based on MARS, a MIPS simulator in Java. 

## 2. Supported Instructions</H3>
### The basic instructions in RV32I are mainly supported.
### Directives and macro are supported.
### A few pseudo-instructions are supportet. we noticed that it's not enough and will be added in the future version.
## 3. Installing and Running</H3>
### There is a .jar in bin, Java JRE required.
### The main class is in **Rars.java** and other sources are in **help**, **images** and **rars**, in case anyone want to compile or view the code
## 4. Examples</H3>
### (1. Open Rars.jar, find **Help→Rars→Examples**. Two example are added there.
### (2. Open file **asm_examples**. More examples will be found to implement Bubblesort and calculate fibonacci.
## 5. Future Work</H3>
### More pseudo-instrucions to be added.
### Syscall will be adjusted to follow the general use of register in Risc-V
