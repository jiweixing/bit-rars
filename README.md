# BIT-RARS : a RISC-V Simulator in Java 


## 1. Introduction
  BIT-RARS is a RISC-V simulator for teaching developed by Yueyan Zhao, Anmin Li and Weixing Ji at Beijing Institute of Technology based on MARS, a MIPS simulator in Java. <br>

## 2. Supported Instructions
  The basic instructions in RV32I are mainly supported.<br>
  Directives and macro are supported.<br>
  A few pseudo-instructions are supportet. we noticed that it's not enough and will be added in the future version.<br>
## 3. Installing and Running
  There is a .jar in bin, Java JRE required.<br>
  The main class is in **Rars.java** and other sources are in **help**, **images** and **rars**, in case anyone want to compile or view the code<br>
## 4. Examples
  (1. Open Rars.jar, find **Help→Rars→Examples**. Two example are added there.<br>
  (2. Open file **asm_examples**. More examples will be found to implement Bubblesort and calculate fibonacci.<br>
## 5. Future Work
  More pseudo-instrucions to be added.<br>
  Syscall will be adjusted to follow the general use of register in Risc-V<br>
